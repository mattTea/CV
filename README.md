## Matt Thompson

A digital product engineer, specialising in React and Ruby web development.
As a business analyst, product delivery coach and engineer I live for building communities, breaking role boundaries and learning. Whilst teaching myself web development I realised how much more I could bring to my teams through using my analysis skills to solve engineering problems. I contributed to the My Account web application at John Lewis & Partners in React, as well as building and launching a learning resources app for the IT delivery organisation, built using React and Firebase, before joining Makers Academy to accelerate the value I can bring to collaborative product development teams.

## Skills

#### Coaching

Learning and curiosity are my constants and I try to bring this to the teams I work with. Fortunately I work in an organisation, an industry and a world that is constantly changing so there are many opportunities. Through a mixture of team and individual coaching and wider training sessions I recently led the ways of working and skills changes required to change a very traditional project organisation into a lean software engineering and learning organisation.

- Created and delivered training sessions on Kanban, flow, the theory of constraints.
- Coached members of the business analysis practice and digital product teams in user research, design thinking and lean delivery.
- Delivered conference talks on how we'd used techniques such as Cynefin and BDD discovery in our requirements engineering approaches.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (February 2019 to May 2019)

- Curious and passionate about code. [PROVIDE EVIDENCE] I began teaching myself web development at the end of 2016 after gaining a huge respect and love for it while working in digital product teams. I started to contribute to the products I was working with shortly after, but wanted a much deeper understanding and practical experience of the practices and approaches that make great engineers, so I joined Makers.
