A business analysis leader and product coach turned software engineer, specialising in JavaScript, Ruby and Kotlin web applications.

As a business analyst, engineer and product delivery coach at John Lewis & Partners I live for building communities, breaking role boundaries and continual learning. I began teaching myself web development at the end of 2016 after gaining a huge respect and love for it while working in digital product teams. I built a number of small React based web apps (including [TinyGigs](http://tinygigs.matttea.com/) and [my blog](http://blog.matttea.com)) before I started to contribute directly to the products I was working with. I joined Makers Academy as I want a much deeper understanding and experience of the practices and approaches that make great engineers, to bring even more value to collaborative product development teams.


## Skills

#### Coaching

Learning and curiosity are my personal and professional priorities, and I always bring this to the teams and individuals I work with.

Through a mixture of team and individual coaching and classroom teaching, I recently led our engineering teams through a number of skills and ways of working changes required to transform a traditional project organisation into a lean software engineering and learning organisation.

- Created and delivered training sessions on Kanban, flow, and the theory of constraints, amongst others.
- Coached members of the business analysis practice and digital product teams in user research, design thinking and lean delivery.
- Delivered conference talks on how we'd used techniques such as Cynefin and BDD discovery in our requirements engineering approaches.


#### Digital Product Delivery

Through measurement and a focus on lean principles (flow, theory of constraints) I have mentored and supported the increased throughout and value in a number of digital product delivery teams.

Using customer research, fast feedback and hypothesis testing techniques, I have supported teams delivering successful MVPs and new propositions with increased customer satisfaction and reduced rework.

- Collaboration of different perspectives
- Prioritisation and MVP scope management


#### Analysis

As a Business Analysis practitioner I focus on requirement discovery and engineering, ensuring the products I work with solve our customers problems.

As a Business Analysis leader I have coached, mentored and developed individuals and communities of practice in the core analysis disciplines required by lean and empowered product teams.

I share my thoughts and lessons at conferences in the UK and Europe to compare and grow my understanding further.

- I delivered learning material and coaching on collaborative requirements discovery techniques such as BDD, story and example mapping and design thinking as part of a skills transformation at John Lewis & Partners. 
- I have spoken on topics such as Cynefin and flexible analysis skills at conferences in both the [UK](https://irmuk.co.uk/events/business-analysis-conference-europe-2017/#session-55) and [Belgium](https://ba-beyond.eu/2019-programme.php#Matt).



## Products

Below are a number of web apps that I have built for learning purposes. And one, solving a particular problem at John Lewis ([delivering our future](https://github.com/mattTea/dof-app)), now has over 200 regular users.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (February 2019 to May 2019)

I'm passionate about learning, and about engineering. I began teaching myself web development after realising how much more I could bring to my teams through using my analysis skills to solve engineering problems. After building a number of small web apps I started to contribute directly to the products I was working with...
- The React UI of the My Account web application at John Lewis & Partners, in order to learn more about TDD practices and continuous delivery.
- Building and launching a [learning resources app](https://github.com/mattTea/dof-app) for our engineering organisation, using React and Firebase, so that I could directly experience customer and user feedback, and understand the demands of supporting and maintaining a product, while continuing to develop it.

At Makers Acadmy I have so far been able to increase my experience of test-driven design and pair programming, with

- Ruby
- RSpec


#### Birkbeck College, University of London (Oct 2003 to Jun 2005)

- MSc International Business Research
- Merit


#### Greenwich University (Sep 1998 to Jun 2002)

- BEng (Hons) Mechanical Engineering
- 2:I
