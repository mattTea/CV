A digital product engineer, specialising in React and Ruby web development.

As a business analyst, engineer and product delivery coach at John Lewis & Partners I live for building communities, breaking role boundaries and learning. Whilst teaching myself web development I realised how much more I could bring to my teams through using my analysis skills to solve engineering problems.

I have contributed to the My Account web application at John Lewis & Partners in React, as well as building and launching a [learning resources app](https://github.com/mattTea/dof-app) for our engineering organisation, using React and Firebase, before joining Makers Academy to really accelerate the value I can bring to collaborative product development teams.

## Skills

#### Coaching

Learning and curiosity are my personal and professional priorities, and I always bring this to the teams I work with. Fortunately I work in an organisation, an industry and a world that is constantly changing so there are plenty of opportunities.

- Through a mixture of team and individual coaching, as well as classroom sessions I recently led many teams through ways of working and skills changes required to change a very traditional project organisation into a lean software engineering and learning organisation.

  - Created and delivered training sessions on Kanban, flow, the theory of constraints.
  - Coached members of the business analysis practice and digital product teams in user research, design thinking and lean delivery.
  - Delivered conference talks on how we'd used techniques such as Cynefin and BDD discovery in our requirements engineering approaches.

#### Digital Product Delivery

Collaboration - different perspectives, prioritisation - MVP and scope management, optimising for flow (lean), fast feedback (agile) 

#### Analysis

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

Changing how we think about analysis, coaching BA practice members in what it means to be a BA in lean, empowered, product teams, requirements discovery, customer focus, hypothesis testing and iterative delivery

Sharing my findings, lessons and ideas at conferences in the UK and Europe to check my thinking and our direction

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (February 2019 to May 2019)

- Curious and passionate about learning, and about engineering. I began teaching myself web development at the end of 2016 after gaining a huge respect and love for it while working in digital product teams. I built a number of small React based web apps ([TinyGigs](http://tinygigs.matttea.com/), [my blog](http://blog.matttea.com)) before I started to contribute directly to the products I was working with. I joined Makers Academy as I want a much deeper understanding and practical experience of the practices and approaches that make great engineers.
